ConnectorIO focuses on safety of software and software integration towards production use.
Over the course of years we developed our own [cloud connector](https://connectorio.com/services/cloud/connectorio-cloud/), which works independently of openHAB cloud as well as an [energy monitoring solution](https://connectorio.com/solutions/energy-monitoring/) suited for resource constrained devices.
We provide a failsafe and hassle free upgrade mechanisms thanks to customized software assemblies and an embedded Linux distribution based on Yocto project.

Our open source integrations work with BACnet, CAN bus, CANopen, OPC UA, Wireless M-Bus, M-Bus as well as with PLC equipment manufactured by Beckhoff, Siemens and Fatek using their proprietary protocols.
